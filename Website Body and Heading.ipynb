       "\"To many professionals, maintaining a work-life balance can seem nearly impossible. Besides staying on top of your work, you also have to spend time with your family, attend to your personal needs, maintain friendships, invest time in hobbies… and fit all of it in the mere 24 hours each day has. Nonetheless, ensuring a healthy work-life balance has many benefits for employees and employers alike, so you’re more than right if you’re looking for ways to master it. Well, look no further - we’ve got you covered! In this article, we will cover everything you need to know about improving work-life balance both as an employee AND as an employer, including: And more! So, let’s jump right in. Simply put, work-life balance means equally prioritizing your work and personal life. Essentially, a good work-life balance allows you to create harmony between both areas of your life and promotes your physical, emotional, financial, and mental well-being. That said, work-life balance doesn’t necessarily mean dividing your time evenly between your work and your personal life.\\xa0 Rather, a good work-life balance comes from having the capacity to complete your professional tasks and still have enough time and energy to spend on things that bring you joy, such as your family, friends, and hobbies. Typically, there are several factors that lead to an unhealthy work-life balance, which include: If you’re unsure whether you have a healthy balance between your work and personal life, here are some of the signs that can help you spot a decline in your work-life balance: Do any of the above-mentioned signs hit too close to home? Worry not!\\xa0 Here are 6 tried-and-tested ways to improve your work-life balance: Ideally, you want to spend 8 hours on work, 8 hours on your friends, family, and hobbies, and 8 hours sleeping each day. As perfect as it sounds, however, this sort of schedule isn’t feasible for most people. Life is unpredictable, and on some days you may have to spend more time with your family or, conversely, a weekend at work. For this reason, it’s important that you don’t put too much pressure on yourself to perfectly stick to your schedule.\\xa0 Instead, you should measure your work-life balance over the long haul. For example, one weekend spent at work won’t affect your work-life balance, but if you spend most of your weekends working, it might take a toll on your family life. As such, you want to set a realistic schedule based on your personal and professional responsibilities and goals.\\xa0 So, let’s say your personal goal is to learn to play the guitar.\\xa0 Sure, it may sound like a good idea to spend an hour every weekday evening strumming the strings, yet chances are more important responsibilities might come up that may change your schedule. As a result, you might not be able to consistently work on your new skill. Rather than allocating a specific time to work on your goals, you want to outline your goals in your weekly schedule (e.g. spend 5 hours in total per week on guitar) and work on them whenever you have the time and energy after you’re finished with your daily responsibilities.\\xa0 As long as you don’t give in to procrastination, this makes it much easier to attain your personal and professional goals, as you don’t have to follow each step in your daily schedule to a T. Your work is important, but if you don’t keep your physical, emotional, and mental health in check, your productivity will suffer - and so will your work-life balance. As such, it’s crucial to first and foremost prioritize your overall health by building healthy daily habits, such as: Prioritizing your health is key to improving your work-life balance, as it also helps you detach from your work outside of your working hours. So, if you have a habit of checking your work emails on your commute, for example, consider using that time for something that supports your overall well-being, whether it’s listening to music, meditating, or chatting with your friends.\\xa0 ‘No’ is a short, yet powerful word - and so, it’s no surprise that many people have a hard time being firm in saying ‘no’ to their employers, family members, and other people. While being a helpful colleague is great, moderation is key as people-pleasing behavior can negatively affect your career and health.\\xa0 For example, you may agree to take on more projects than you physically can complete, which can lead you to unmet deadlines and expectations, little to no time for personal life, and burnout in the workplace. As such, learning to say ‘no’ is vital to improving your work-life balance since it allows you to set boundaries and create harmony between your work and personal life. Just think about it - if you set the right priorities at work and at home, learning to say ‘no’ to lower priority tasks will allow you to have more time for meaningful activities both at home and at work. Saying ‘no’ at work doesn’t come easy? Consider proposing an alternative. For example, if a colleague asks you to take on a task, negotiate to take on just a part of it or ask them to help you with a task you're currently working on first.\\xa0 Truth be told, people aren’t designed to work non-stop, and you may be surprised to find out that working long hours doesn't increase your productivity.\\xa0 In fact, according to research, the most productive employees have 17-minute breaks following every 52 minutes of work.\\xa0 As such, to improve your work-life balance AND productivity, it’s important that you take regular breaks while working. Not to mention, you should use your breaks to the fullest instead of checking your emails or scrolling industry-related news. So, here are some tips to ensure high-quality breaks that will leave you refreshed and energized: Maintaining a good work-life balance can be significantly harder when you’re working from home - at the end of the day, your home is also your office, so you may find it hard to separate the two.
